# Initial Setup

This is my notebook, dump, log for the initial setup I did coming from a blank slate in Windows.

1. Git clone dotfiles
2. Followed ubuntu/ folder and fixed some things
3. Added go install script
4. amended some breaking changes in neovim
5. Downloaded fonts

WSL will be highly dependent on the distro you install. For most cases, I will
be using Ubuntu as my distro.
