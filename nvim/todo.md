# Add:
- [ ] general interface / api to change the transparency config of any theme
- [ ] tie this api to the refactored theming system

---
# Done:

1. 'jk' keymap to go to normal mode from insert mode. 
2. go to implementations
3. keymap similar to vscode refactor button
6. look for git sidebar / source control?
7. line numbers in netrw
8. fix lsp errors exceeding color column
9. add formatter

- [x] docker lsp
- [x] make a jumper plugin for when you return back to where you came from after a `gd`. Make it quick and toggleable like harpoon.
    * used tagstack
- [x] tmux: style the window when sessionzing
    - sessionizing is now just a fzf-tmux popup
